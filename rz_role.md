Here’s a practical guide for your friend in Vancouver if they get fired. I've included actionable steps and links to relevant resources.

### 1. **Check Employment Termination Notice or Severance Pay**
   - If your friend has worked for the company for three consecutive months or more, they are entitled to either termination notice or severance pay, depending on the employment contract.
